# macOS Version with Uptime

Ãœbersicht widget to display the macOS name, version and build on the desktop.  
Additionally it shows the system uptime.  
The Build number can be hidden and the widget is themable.  
Five themes are included: mono, paper, dark, myDark and color.

This is my second version. This time it is written using REACT.
